# Navigation & Visibility Improvements

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… Highlights Now Persist During Navigation

**Problem:** Highlights only appeared after a hard refresh, not when navigating between pages.

**Solution:** Added intelligent navigation detection and automatic re-rendering:

- **SPA Navigation Detection** - Intercepts `pushState`/`replaceState` to detect single-page app navigation
- **URL Change Monitoring** - Watches for URL changes via popstate, pushstate, and replacestate events  
- **Automatic Reload** - When URL changes, clears old highlights and loads new ones for the current page
- **DOM Change Observer** - Detects when page content changes and re-renders highlights if they disappeared

### 2. âœ… More Translucent Highlights

**Problem:** Yellow highlight was too opaque, making light-colored text hard to read.

**Solution:** Reduced highlight opacity for better text visibility:

- **Normal state:** `rgba(255, 237, 123, 0.25)` - Was 0.4, now 0.25 (37% less opaque)
- **Hover state:** `rgba(255, 237, 123, 0.35)` - Was 0.6, now 0.35 (42% less opaque)
- **Border:** Slightly more transparent too for a cleaner look

## How It Works

### Navigation Detection

```javascript
// Detects SPA navigation (React, Vue, etc.)
history.pushState â†’ triggers reload
history.replaceState â†’ triggers reload
popstate event â†’ triggers reload

// When URL changes:
1. Clear all existing highlights
2. Wait 500ms for content to load
3. Fetch annotations for new URL
4. Render highlights
```

### Content Change Detection

```javascript
// Monitors DOM for changes
MutationObserver â†’ watches document.body

// If content changes and highlights disappeared:
1. Wait 1 second for changes to settle
2. Check if we have annotations but no visible highlights
3. Re-render all highlights
```

## What You'll Experience

### âœ… Better Navigation
- Click links on a website â†’ highlights appear automatically
- Use browser back/forward â†’ highlights update correctly
- SPA navigation (React apps, etc.) â†’ highlights follow along
- No more need for hard refresh!

### âœ… Better Readability
- Light text on highlights is much easier to read
- Subtle, non-intrusive appearance
- Still clear enough to see the annotation
- Hover state provides clear feedback

## Testing

1. **Reload extension** at `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Refresh your webpage** (one last time!)
3. **Create an annotation**
4. **Navigate to another page** on the same site
5. **Navigate back** â†’ Highlight should appear automatically!

## Edge Cases Handled

âœ… **SPA Navigation** - Works with React, Vue, Angular
âœ… **Traditional Navigation** - Works with regular page loads
âœ… **Back/Forward** - Browser navigation works correctly
âœ… **Dynamic Content** - Handles pages that load content async
âœ… **Multiple Annotations** - All highlights render correctly

## Performance

- **Debounced** - DOM observer waits 1 second before re-rendering
- **Smart Detection** - Only re-renders if highlights are missing
- **Efficient** - Doesn't re-render if highlights already visible
- **Non-Blocking** - 500ms delay allows page content to load first

## Console Messages

You'll now see helpful logs when navigating:

```
[Graphiti] [INFO] ContentScript: URL changed, reloading annotations
[Graphiti] [INFO] ContentScript: Annotations loaded { count: 2 }
[Graphiti] [INFO] ContentScript: Content changed, re-rendering highlights
```

Enjoy seamless annotation browsing! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
